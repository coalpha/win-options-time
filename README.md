# win-options-time

*Now you can get options advice from your clock!*

I don't really have a good reason for making this other than "iT wAs A gOoD
lEaRnInG eXpErIeNcE".
Rust is pretty nice though. IDE support has gotten less bad with `rust-analyzer`
integration into VSCode. I must say, the syntax is kind of overwhelming but it's
way better than something with significant whitespace.

Here's what it looks like on the taskbar:

It also shows up on anything that uses the builtin win32 APIs to format time.

It's kinda rough when some of these plays are less stupid than the ones I make.
