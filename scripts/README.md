# batch script

You could download this and run it if you don't want to run my binary.
But cmoooon... Why *wouldn't* you trust a random person on the internet?
I mean, if you're on WSB, you're already outsourcing your investment strategy to
a random reddit user.

In all seriousness, this batch file should functionally do the exact same thing.
I just figured that I'd package it up into an executable that auto-elevated so
it was easier to use.
